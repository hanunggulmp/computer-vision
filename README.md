# Computer Vision - CNN
> My project of computer vision with convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using pytorch
#### This project aims to make computers process and analyze images, then extract the details in the same way a human mind does. The program will have several image to be trained and consist of 70 classes (types) of air plane iamge

Download Training dataset at here [Training](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1asGBvSPPITYs9Px61FqRPzmjdQnnzD0d).

Download Testing dataset at here [Testing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Apa-dUvxjkbf_Kra7eQc_0eDvrDgXE2M).

## Running the program
- Extract the training and testing dataset
- To train the model, open cnn.ipnyb and run all the code. It will generate the trained model (trained_model.pt)
- To open and run trained model, open test_template_example.ipynb and run all the code.
It will load the trained model (trained_model.pt) and saved as a new model
